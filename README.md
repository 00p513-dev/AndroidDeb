# What is AndroidDeb ?

Think Android is a pain? Want to run nginx anywhere? Got an android phone, with an unlocked bootloader? 

AndroDeb is a hacky effort to port a recent Debian to run on an android phone. No chroot, no android guts whatsoever. Just pure Debian. We try to make it work with the least effort, therefore:

* Kernels built from published vendor SDK. Forward-porting all the vendor hacks is a tedious, nearly impossible task and is outside of the scope of this project

* A minimal initrd is provided to mount the actual root partition and do any hardware-specific setup

\* Battery Hack is a mod to the PMIC driver that changes the maximum voltage
for the battery from 4-4.2 volts to 3.7-3.8 volts. This allows to avoid 'bloating' batteries when you keep your phone always charged.

# How to build

- System Requirements.
    1. A recent Debian Stretch or Debian jessie linux distro
    2. Development packages: multistrap build-essential cmake
    3. Caffeine

- Clone the AndroDeb repository.


```
git clone https://github.com/00p513-dev/AndroDeb
```

docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register


- Create a build directory and configure the build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DDEVICE_NAME=iocean-x8
```

Check the table above for available devices

- Run 'make'

```
make
```

- Grab yourself a coffee, this will take a while

- Get your firmware in build/firmware and flash it with SP Flash Tool

- PROFIT!

# How to port

- Find a suitable kernel kitchen. If your cellphone has the same SoC as one of the above you may well be lucky.

- Make yourself familiar with firmware compilation and packaging process. This may be tricky.

- Add this to the end of the kernel config. This should do the minimal trick (See comments for individual parameters)
```
# Systemd will not work without these
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y
CONFIG_CGROUPS=y
CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y
CONFIG_SIGNALFD=y
CONFIG_TIMERFD=y
CONFIG_EPOLL=y
CONFIG_NET=y
CONFIG_SYSFS=y
CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
CONFIG_FHANDLE=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_HMAC=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=y
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=n
CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK=n
CONFIG_EXT4_FS_XATTR=y

# Needed for iotop to work
CONFIG_TASKSTATS=y
CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT=y
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING=y
```


- Compile your own kernel

- Write a platforms/your_phone/platform.mk and send us your patches!
